                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The original idea for Postwar Trials in Catalonia was born during Fall 2020. I was writing a paper for the seminar Archives, Records and Memory about a compilation of letters written by victims of the immediate postwar repression (1939-44) in the province of Girona, Catalonia (Spain). While doing research on the current legal status of these crimes, I found out they were officially declared null in Catalonia in 2017, while still continuing to be legally binding in the rest of Spain. As a part of the process of reparation to the family of the victims, the Generalitat de Catalunya (Catalonia’s regional government) gave permission to the National Catalan Archive to publish all the names and information they could find on the archives of the 63,961 defendants that had to undergo court-martial trials between 1939 and 1978. This publication has been, since then, available for everyone to consult online or download, titled <em>La sèrie documental: Procediments judicials militars sumaríssims</em> (Arxiu Nacional de Catalunya, 2017).
<br><br>But while browsing the list, I realized how useful it would be to make the data contained in that PDF file more accessible and easily searchable to the public. Thus, Postwar Trials in Catalonia was born.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Those were the crimes the Causa General (1940) targeted and prosecuted: the defense of the interests the insurgent side upheld (Religion, Fatherland, Family, Order and Property) required, by that administration, the eradication of, in General Emilio Mola’s words, “of those who don’t think like we do” (Preston, 28). Under the Ley de responsabilidades políticas (1939), the decade of purge and violence known as the First Francoism saw the prosecution of those who had hindered “el triumfo providencial e históricamente inaludible del Movimiento Nacional” so they could erase “sus yerros pasados (…) y puedan convivir dentro de una España grande y rindan a sus servicio todos sus esfuerzos y todos sus sacrificios” (BOE, 02/13/1939, 824). This judicial process was also to bring justice to the victims of the repression on the sites where the Republic had resisted during the three years the civil war lasted. Preston quotes the calculations of José Luis Ledesma of 49,272 victims as the most accurate, and attributes this precision to the records of identified bodies kept by Republican authorities, as well as the posterior investigations made by the dictatorship (29). However, the deaths of Republican soldiers or civilians on the Francoist side are much more difficult to estimate due to the lack of records (which we’ll return to later), and the fact that no serious investigations could be carried out before Franco’s death in 1975. Preston estimates the number of extra-judicial victims of “no fewer than 150.000” (35), to which we must add 20.000 more executions of Republican people after Franco’s victory in 1939 (16).<br><br>Out of this last figure, Preston points out, Catalonia had a relatively low number of victims of retaliation, mainly due to its closeness to the border with France, which allowed most of the potential targets to escape during the end of January of 1939. While, for instance, Valencia had 15,000 people jailed (of which 4,700 were executed, and 1,165 died in prison), in Catalonia these numbers decreased by half (1365-6). Still, between March of 1939 and January of 1945<strong>, 2,840+ALTRES</strong>&nbsp;men and women were executed by firing squad. Officially, in almost all of their death certificates, it was documented they had died of cardiac arrest (Lorenzo and Llorenç, 15).&nbsp;<br> </p>

                    In this data visualization, we are given evidence that, despite the executions by fire squad being one of the most infamous elements of the Francoist repression, they represented a small percentage of the total amount. While that doesn't make the number any less significant (3,368, out of&nbsp;63,961 trials), it also highlights that postwar retaliation and ideological prosecution may take many forms, but we often only focus on the most brutal ones. It also shows how, despite the initial reaction of retaliation decreased after 1944, the number of martial-court cases had a unsteady growth and decrease all through the dictatorship.&nbsp;</p>

                    Talk about my original idea with the map? Importance of acknowledging victims? (Assmann?). While the elaboration of an individual map is a project that will have to be, for know, shelved, still wanted to elaborate a piece of data visualization that allows for people to look for individual defendants. Hence: this. It might crash, honestly.&nbsp;</p>

The question implicit in Labanyi’s writing is, then, how can there be forgiveness and healing when, for more than sixty years, there has been a lack of interlocutors that are willing to assume any kind of responsibility. In fact, she points out that not only there were no official attempts of investigation, but that there also have not existed any steps towards reconciliation.
<br><br>, against the inactivity for decades of the Spanish government in what could be considered part of the “structural violence caused by the bureaucracy and especially, recordkeeping” (or a lack of thereof) Gilliland and McKemish mention when, in a similar historical context, reflect on the aftermath of the Yugoslav Wars (111). Archives and recordkeeping can be and usually are tools to determine who controls the narrative that the mainstream collective memory discourse takes, particularly on an institutional level. Even after the democratic transition, he adds, it was not until 1985 that the Spanish government started to take some steps to protect the state archive’s resources. <br><br><br>One of the main reasons for the significant support to this opposition to look back in the past has been the Amnesty Law of 1977 that, while it granted an amnesty to all political prisoners, also prevented the prosecution and trial of any crime related to the dictatorship era. Since then, there have been petitions to derogate this amnesty; international ones, like U.N.’s call to revoke this so-called pacto de silencio (“deal of silence”), as well as calls from the republican leftist party Unidas Podemos as well as multiple Catalan and Basque nationalist parties. So far, the amnesty is still in place, and this attests the difficulty of this topic still in present day Spain and the significance of contesting the official narrative of oblivion through the creation of private archives that bear witness of a forcibly forgotten past.
