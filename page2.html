                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The original idea for Postwar Trials in Catalonia was born during Fall 2020. I was writing a paper for the seminar Archives, Records and Memory about a compilation of letters written by victims of the immediate postwar repression (1939-44) in the province of Girona, Catalonia (Spain). While doing research on the current legal status of these crimes, I found out they were officially declared null in Catalonia in 2017, while still continuing to be legally binding in the rest of Spain. As a part of the process of reparation to the family of the victims, the <em>Generalitat de Catalunya</em> (Catalonia’s regional government) gave permission to the National Catalan Archive to publish all the names and information they could find on the archives of the 63,961 defendants that had to undergo court-martial trials between 1939 and 1978. This publication has been, since then, <a href="http://anc.gencat.cat/ca/detall/noticia/Llista-de-processos-instruits-pel-regim-franquista" class="text-primary">available</a> for everyone to consult online or download, titled <em>La sèrie documental: Procediments judicials militars sumaríssims</em> (Arxiu Nacional de Catalunya, 2017).
<br><br>But while browsing the list, I realized how useful it would be to make the data contained in that PDF file more accessible and easily searchable to the public. Thus, Postwar Trials in Catalonia was born. Its principal objective is to illustrate the data contained in that lengthy dataset in order to make it more accessible and comprehensible to the public, as it contains information that had not been available for the last 80 years to the general audience. In addition, this project will also offer some data contextualization, and will ponder on the questions this data lays out for future research and discourse around this topic.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></p>

The coup was only successful in some parts of the territory, which lead to the Spanish Civil War.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>1938&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;The rebel army begins the Catalonia offensive: after winning the battle in the Ebre River, the Francoist troops entered the region through Lleida (west) and Tarragona (south) and circled Barcelona.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>1939&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong>On January 26th, the Francoist army takes Barcelona. Tens of thousands of Catalans depart the country towards France, fearing retaliation. In March, Franco takes Madrid and, on the 1st of April, declares the end of the Civil War.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>1939-1944&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong>After seizing the control of the state, the Falangist faction implemented a systematic and institutionalized repression against the losing faction. This period, known as “The White Terror”, or "The Francoist Repression", took place during the first decade, and was specially brutal during the first half, with an estimated number of between 160,000 - 200,000 victims.&nbsp;<br></li>
                    <li><strong>1944-1975</strong><br>Over the next decades, Franco's dictatorship would persevere through the Second World War and the Cold War. Despite a gradual economic liberalization, ideological dissenters were prosecuted (and some, executed) until the end of the dictatorship.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li><strong>1975</strong><br>On November 20th, Francisco Franco dies. Its administration, pressured by internal and external factions, will begin a transition process to democracy.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li><strong>1977&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br>The Amnesty Law is approved. It will also be known as "the Deal of Silence". It posits an amnesty for all the dictatorship's political prisoners, but at the same time, it prevented prosecution of any crimes committed by the Franco administration, both during the Civil War and the dictatorship.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li><strong>1978<br></strong>Presentation and approval of the new Spanish Constitution with a 88'54% of positive vote in a referendum, out of a 67'11% of total electoral turnout.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>1981&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong>A military coup attempt against the newly elected democratic government is thwarted.

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5">The White Terror, a institutionalized postwar retaliation</h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">"<em>En el día de hoy, cautivo y desarmado el Ejército Rojo, han alcanzado las tropas nacionales sus últimos objetivos militares. La guerra ha terminado</em>" [Today the Red Army has been captured and disarmed, and the National troops have reached their last objectives. The war is over]. With this brief <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Spain_final-guerra-civil.jpg" class="text-primary">message</a> to be broadcasted of the National Radio, written by Francisco Franco himself on April 1st 1939, the Spanish Civil War was over. After the fall of Catalonia, that had been acting as the Republic center of operations in January, and Madrid's in late March, the Francoist army culminated the coup started in 1936 against the Republican government. However, not satisfied by the violent response against Republican troops and civilians during the war years, the newly appointed totalitarian administration set out to work on an extensive piece of legislation with the objective of prosecuting any ideological or political dissidence to the movement of La Falange. <br><br>This process would be called&nbsp;<em>Causa General</em> (1940) and it targeted and prosecuted any belief that went against the ideals the insurgent side upheld (Religion, Fatherland, Family, Order and Property) required, by that administration, the eradication of, in General Emilio Mola’s words, “of those who don’t think like we do” (Preston, 28). Under the <em>Ley de</em> <em>responsabilidades</em> <em>políticas </em>[Law of Political Responsabilities]&nbsp;(1939), the decade of purge and violence known as the First Francoism saw the prosecution of those who had hindered “<em>el triumfo providencial e históricamente inaludible del Movimiento Nacional</em>” so they could erase “<em>sus yerros pasados (…) y puedan convivir dentro de una España grande y rindan a sus servicio todos sus esfuerzos y todos sus sacrificios”</em> [the providential and historically inevitable triumph of the National Movement ... their past mistakes and could coexist within a great Spain to which they can dedicate all their efforts and sacrifices] (BOE, 02/13/1939, 824). <br><br>This judicial process was also to bring justice to the victims of the repression on the sites where the Republic had resisted during the three years the civil war lasted. Preston quotes the calculations of José Luis Ledesma of 49,272 victims as the most accurate, and attributes this precision to the records of identified bodies kept by Republican authorities, as well as the posterior investigations made by the dictatorship (Preston, 29). However, the deaths of Republican soldiers or civilians on the Francoist side are much more difficult to estimate due to the lack of records -since there was a deliberate destruction of records and archives during the sixties (Preston, 31-32) and the fact that no serious investigations could be carried out before Franco’s death in 1975. Preston estimates the number of extra-judicial victims of “no fewer than 150.000” (35), to which we must add 20.000 more executions of Republican people after Franco’s victory in 1939 (16).<br> </p>

                        This piece of legislation, approved on February 9th, 1939 (a just under two months before the Civil War ended), called for the "expiation of culpability"&nbsp;of those who had contributed --by act or omission-- to the "red subversion" (referring to the Second Spanish Republic, 1936-9), and to "keep it alive for two years".&nbsp;</p>

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">Out of this last figure, Preston points out, Catalonia had a relatively low number of victims of retaliation, mainly due to its closeness to the border with France, which allowed most of the potential targets to escape during the end of January of 1939. While, for instance, Valencia had 15,000 people jailed (of which 4,700 were executed, and 1,165 died in prison), in Catalonia these numbers decreased by half (1365-6). Still, between March of 1939 and January of 1945, 3,202 men and women were executed by firing squad. Officially, in almost all of their death certificates, it was documented they had died of cardiac arrest (Lorenzo and Llorenç, 15).</h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">However, as we can see in the visualization below, while systematic executions (often by firing squat)&nbsp;being one of the most infamous elements of the Francoist repression, they represented a small -albeit significant- percentage of the total amount out of the total amount of sentences called by martial-courts during that first period of repression. While that doesn't make the number any less significant (being a total of <strong>3,368</strong> executions out of 63,961 trials), it also highlights that despite often focusing on the most brutal ones, postwar retaliation and ideological prosecution may take many forms. It also shows how, despite the initial reaction of retaliation decreased after 1944, the number of martial-court cases had an unsteady growth and decrease all through the dictatorship, which can lead us to question what events took place during those years that sparked these peaks in political prosecution. We can also observe how, during the Transition Period, characterized by protests and riots, the number of martial-court cases shows a minor but unwavering increase.&nbsp;</p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">One of the most significant effects of the <em>Causa General</em>&nbsp;was the attempt to forge a new national identity "according to the National spirit of the War effort" (Richards, 127) and therefore,&nbsp;eliminating any discourse that threatened Francoism’s main narrative. Richards refers to it as “an imposed quarantine or silencing signified the continuation of war as a work of cultural destruction in the broadest sense” (2), and points out that, thanks to this institutionalization of victory and defeat, the Falange were able to monopolize the public memory and the public voice (4).&nbsp;<br><br>Vital to this domain of the public narrative about the revolution and the war was the silencing of the repressed parts through the Causal General, in which the atmosphere of fear "had real effects on social relations to memory: morality and solidarity were undermined in the rush to demonstrate loyalty", since even those who were desperate and fearful would denounce their neighbors. Richards points out this fear even divided generations within families, and kids were kept in the dark about their parents recent past out of the concern they might share it with others, and they would be accused of having aided or sympathized with the Republican side (127).&nbsp;<br><br>This might explain why, after the ferocity of the first few years, where the most recurring verdict to the court-martial trials was long prison sentences, the for instance, a decade after. In 1939, 7,566 men were sentenced to 12 years of jail in 1939; 3,350 to 20 years; 2,989 to 15 years, and 3,527 to death and 277 sent to labor or concentration camps. However, by 1946, out of 369 total trials, 127 were let go under varying degrees of responsibility; 116 received prison sentences between 6 months and 6 years; 17 were sentenced to 20-year sentences and 14 received death sentences. After seven years of suspicion, denunciation and institutionalized executions of political dissidence, the fear of being accused and tried often acted as a deterrent to any kind of organized resistance.&nbsp;<br><br>The data visualization below not only permits to see the evolution of the type of sentencing the defendants received over the years, but also the disparity in numbers and sentences between men and women. In 1939, 41,900 men underwent a martial-court trial in Catalonia, compared to 4,049 women. Out of these women defendants, 2,177 received different degrees of acquittal, while we have to go to the fourth most recurring sentence to see the first major prison sentences (395 were condemned to 12 years of reclusion), and finally, 33 were sentenced to death. The Falange, the only party allowed by the Franco administration, was intensely catholic and conservative and therefore, women were relegated to the private sphere, and that seems to have included the avoidance of public castigation. <br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-description mbr-fonts-style mt-2 align-center display-4">Despite executions being the most infamous result of court-trials, data shows that long prison sentences were the prevalent repressive sentence given to defendants in the first years. Despite this, it's relevant to notice that up to the last years of the dictatorship, there were still executions for political reasons.&nbsp;</p>

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">However, as D'Ignazio and Klein point out in Data Feminism, the institutional domain often codifies oppression "through bureaucracy and hierarchy, rather than through laws that explicitly encode inequality" (Ch. 1), and leaves out kinds of violence and discrimination that despite being used as instruments of repression are not accounted for in institutional data, may it be because they mostly affect women (like sexual violence), may it be because the total amount of cases is still unclear (like torture), or difficult to determine in terms of quantifiable data (like marginalization and stigmatization).&nbsp;<div><br></div><br><div><br></div></h4>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Out of the four provinces of Catalonia, the one with a more elevated concentration of cases is Barcelona. It has historically been the most demographically dense region in all Catalonia, but this based-on step values graph shows how the migratory movements from the beginning of the 20th century can explain how the province of Barcelona quadruplicates the number of cases. This province had a positive net migration rate, whilst all the other ones had a negative one.&nbsp;<br><br>NOT SUPER SURE ABOUT THIS YET BUT PROBABLY SOMETHING WITH DEMOGRAPHIC MOVEMENT? CHECK IF I CAN FIND ANY SOURCES BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT TYPE OF REPRESSION IN CAPITAL / CITIES VS. RURAL AREAS.&nbsp;</p>

The question implicit in Labanyi’s writing is, then, how can there be forgiveness and healing when, for more than sixty years, there has been a lack of interlocutors that are willing to assume any kind of responsibility. In fact, she points out that not only there were no official attempts of investigation, but that there also have not existed any steps towards reconciliation.
<br><br>, against the inactivity for decades of the Spanish government in what could be considered part of the “structural violence caused by the bureaucracy and especially, recordkeeping” (or a lack of thereof) Gilliland and McKemish mention when, in a similar historical context, reflect on the aftermath of the Yugoslav Wars (111). Archives and recordkeeping can be and usually are tools to determine who controls the narrative that the mainstream collective memory discourse takes, particularly on an institutional level. Even after the democratic transition, he adds, it was not until 1985 that the Spanish government started to take some steps to protect the state archive’s resources. <br><br><br>One of the main reasons for the significant support to this opposition to look back in the past has been the Amnesty Law of 1977 that, while it granted an amnesty to all political prisoners, also prevented the prosecution and trial of any crime related to the dictatorship era. Since then, there have been petitions to derogate this amnesty; international ones, like U.N.’s call to revoke this so-called pacto de silencio (“deal of silence”), as well as calls from the republican leftist party Unidas Podemos as well as multiple Catalan and Basque nationalist parties. So far, the amnesty is still in place, and this attests the difficulty of this topic still in present day Spain and the significance of contesting the official narrative of oblivion through the creation of private archives that bear witness of a forcibly forgotten past.
